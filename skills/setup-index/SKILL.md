# Set Up Video Index

The **video index** is the top-level directory under which every video project lives as a subfolder. This skill registers (or creates) that directory.

## Procedure

### 1. Check for existing config

```bash
DATA_DIR="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/claude-media-plugins/video-editing"
INDEX_FILE="$DATA_DIR/index.json"
test -f "$INDEX_FILE" && cat "$INDEX_FILE"
```

If one exists, show the user the current path and ask if they want to keep or change it.

### 2. Ask the user

1. **Existing or new?** — do they already have an index, or should one be created?
2. **Path?**
   - Existing: ask for absolute path; verify with `test -d`.
   - New: propose `~/media-workspaces/video` as the default. Don't auto-create until the user confirms the path.

### 3. Create + persist

```bash
mkdir -p "$DATA_DIR"
mkdir -p "<chosen-path>"   # only if new
```

Write `index.json`:

```json
{
  "path": "/absolute/path",
  "created": "<ISO-8601>",
  "type": "video"
}
```

### 4. Offer follow-up

Suggest the user run `profile-system` next (so render commands know what GPU/encoders to use). Mention they can now say "open my video index" or "create a new video project".
